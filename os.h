 * \section assumptions GLOBAL ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 *    (ATMEL specific)
 *  - Counter1 Timer and SWI interrupts are reserved.
 *
 *  - All runtime exceptions (where assumptions are violated) or other
 *    unrecoverable errors get handled by calling OS_Abort().
 *  - Each valid entry in PPP[] must be non-zero except IDLE.
 *  - All unspecified runtime errors have undefined behaviours, e.g., stack overflow.
 *  - PPP[] \b cannot be modified once the application starts running.
 *
 * \section policy SCHEDULING POLICY
 *
 *   There are three scheduling levels: SYSTEM, PERIODIC and RR.
 *   These levels are prioritized with SYSTEM being the highest, and RR being
 *   the lowest.
 *
 *   Preemption occurs immediately. Whenever preemption is feasible, it takes
 *   place instantly. As soon as a higher priority task becomes ready, it
 *   preempts all lower priority tasks.
 *
 * \section system SYSTEM TASKS
 *
 *   SYSTEM (level) tasks are FCFS; they run to completion, i.e., until they
 *   terminate, block or yield. Thus, they are non-preemptible, not even by
 *   other SYSTEM tasks. They should only be used for critical system level
 *   activities, e.g., error or fault recovery. Running too many SYSTEM tasks
 *   could affect the real time performance  of all other low level tasks.
 *
 *
 * \section periodic PERIODIC TASKS
 *
 *   PERIODIC tasks are scheduled based on a fixed cyclic scheduling plan;
 *   they are time-based. (See below about PPP[].) Since they are time-critical,
 *   they are \b NOT allowed to block (i.e., wait on an event).
 *   When a PERIODIC task is created, it is assigned a "name",
 *   a non-zero user-defined constant between 1 and MAXPROCESS.
 *   This name is fixed and can NEVER be changed again.
 *   No two PERIODIC tasks have the same name. All names are unique.
 *   Since tasks may terminate and be created again over time,
 *   the same name may be reused over time for different PERIODIC task
 *   instance.
 *
 *   The PPP[] array is essentially a linear representation of a Gantt diagram.
 *   It is an array of [Name1, Interval1, Name2, Interval 2, ... ].
 *   The name of every PERIODIC task must appear in PPP[] array at least once,
 *   but may be more than once.
 *
 *   For example, if we create three PERIODIC tasks with names A, B and
 *   C out of three functions P(), Q() and R() respectively. Then,
 *   PPP[] = { A, 2, B, 3, A, 5, C, 1 } means executing A for 2 ticks,
 *   then B for 3 ticks, then A again for 5 ticks, then C for 1 tick,
 *   then A again, and so on. The total cycle time is 2+3+5+1=11 ticks.
 *   That is, within 11 ticks, A executes twice, B once and C once.
 *   If P() terminates, but the name A is later assigned to another function U(),
 *   then A will be executed again according to PPP[] order using U().
 *   In a sense, PPP[] specifies at least a single execution cycle
 *   of all PERIODIC tasks. IDLE is a special PERIODIC task name, which means
 *   do nothing during this task's assigned interval.
 *
 *   A PERIODIC task may yield (calling Task_Next()) to relinquish
 *   the processor before its assigned interval. In this case, it has completed
 *   its current execution interval and is waiting for its next interval.
 *
 *   It is a runtime error if a PERIODIC task executes longer than the
 *   currently assigned interval. It is important NOT to underestimate
 *   the execution time requirement of a PERIODIC task. Choosing the appropriate
 *   execution order and intervals for all PERIODIC tasks is the responsibility
 *   of the Application Design Engineer(s), not our RTOS. Hence, all timing
 *   violations should be caught and then reported.
 *
 *   By specifying PPP[] and scheduling our PERIODIC tasks accordingly,
 *   we shall know precisely the execution "cycle" time of all such tasks,
 *   thus their best execution frequency/rate and response time. This is how
 *   we guarantee the predictability of timing and ordering all critical
 *   activities.
 *
 *  \section rr RR TASKS
 *
 *   RR tasks are scheduled in a round-robin fashion, i.e., each RR
 *   task runs for one TICK approximately and yields to the next RR task. They
 *   don't have any time critical schedule to follow, thus they share the
 *   processor cycles fairly.
 *
 *   RR tasks are allowed to run \a only when no PERIODIC or SYSTEM tasks
 *   are executing. When an RR task resumes after pre-emption,
 *   it re-enters its RR level at the end. When an RR task
 *   yields, or resumes after being unblocked, it re-enters its level
 *   at the end as well.
 *
 *
 *  \section boot OS BOOTING
 *     Our RTOS is compiled together with an application. The main() function
 *     is defined in the RTOS and calls OS_Init.  The application main function
 *     is called r_main().
 *     -# OS_Init() is called from the main() function
 *     -# Upon completion of OS_Init(), the application's r_main() is then
 *        created as the first and only SYSTEM level task.
 *     -# In r_main(), the rest of the application tasks are then created.
 *     -# In order for all other application tasks to run, our r_main() task
 *        must either terminate or block on an event. (For example, r_main()
 *        may become a "watchdog" task to reset the entire application.)
 *
 *
 * \section ipc INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION
 *
 *    Events are one-way synchronization signals. They don't have any "memory"
 *    (i.e., values); thus, they are NOT semaphores. Any SYSTEM or RR task may
 *    wait on an event; PERIODIC tasks \b MUST \b NOT wait on any event.
 *    However, any task may signal/broadcast an event.
 *    A waiting task is resumed when the associated event is signaled.
 *    All waiting tasks are resumed when the associated event is broadcasted.
 *    When an event is signaled (or broadcasted) but there are no waiting tasks,
 *    this is a \a no-op; hence, events have \b no memory.
